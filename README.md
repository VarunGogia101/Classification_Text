# Classification_Text

This machine learning program is designed to classify multi-class categories of the text. It can be used on different textual datasets. The size of the dataset, this program was tested on is about 3500 commit messages with 5 different labels. The classifier was evaluated by the claculated precision of 0.96, and recall of 0.94.


In more simple words, any developer at any time during different phases of the project can write pieces of code that aims to implement one of the followings:
1 represents commit messages for bug fixing.
2 represents commits that belong to no category.
3 represents commit messages for design improvement.
